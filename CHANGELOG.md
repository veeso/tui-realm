## 1.7.1

Released on 03/08/2022

- Fixed [issue 40](https://github.com/veeso/tui-realm/issues/40)

## 1.7.0

Released on 23/06/2022

- Added `unwrap()` methods to `State` and `StaateValue`
- Added `StateValue::None`

## 1.6.0

Released on 29/04/2022

- Updated `crossterm` to `0.23`
- Updated `tui` to `0.18`
- Fixed build issue on nightly toolchain

## 1.5.0

Released on 06/03/2022

- Updated `tui` to `0.17`
- Added **Injectors**
  - Properties injectors are trait objects, which must implement the `Injector` trait, which can provide some property (defined as a tuple of `Attribute` and `AttrValue`) for components when they're mounted.
  - Read more in [advanced concepts](/docs/en/advanced.md#properties-injectors)

## 1.4.2

Released on 04/01/2022

- Added `focus()` method to `Application` which returns a reference to id of the current active component in the `View`

## 1.4.1

Released on 27/12/2021

- Fixed serialization for key events
- Removed serde for `Event`

## 1.4.0

Released on 24/12/2021

- Added `serialize` feature: once this feature is enabled, the `Serialize` and the `Deserialize` traits will be available for certain entities:
  - `Key`, `KeyEvent` and `KeyModifiers`: this will give you the possibility to use these entities in a serialized data for configuring keybindings.
  - `Event`: implemented in order to provide a Port with commands from an external source.

## 1.3.0

Released on 28/11/2021

- Added `lock_ports()` and `unlock_ports()` to pause event listener.
  - Once `lock_ports()` is called, **Ports** won't be polled as long as `unlock_ports()` is not called.
  - by default ports are **Unlocked**

## 1.2.1

Released on 27/11/2021

- `TextSpan` `From` trait implementation, now accepts `AsRef<str>`

## 1.2.0

Released on 25/11/2021

> Yet, another update üôÑ

- Application API:
  - Added `lock_subs()` and `unlock_subs()` methods.
    - Once `lock_subs()` is called, events won't be anymore propagated to subscriptions as long as `unlock_subs()` is not called.
    - by default events **will be propagated** to subs.
- Sub Clause:
  - Added `Id` to `HasAttr` and `HasState` sub clauses.
  - Added new `IsMounted(Id)` sub clause

## 1.1.2

Released on 23/11/2021

> ‚ùó There's no 1.1.1 version. Since I don't like it as a version number, I decided to skip it

- Application API changes:
  - Removed `sanitize` since `View` is no more accessible
  - Added `umount_all` method which umounts all components from `View` and active subscriptions

## 1.1.0

Released on 21/11/2021

- `tick()` will now return a `Vec<Msg>`. There's no need to pass an `Update` trait anymore
  - The reasons behind this is that it was too annoying to handle the model in a separate structure which could not render the Ui.
- Exposed `PollStrategy` at root level

## 1.0.1

Released on 20/11/2021

- Improved performance for crossterm listener

## 1.0.0

Released on 13/11/2021

- New API; view docs

## 0.6.0

Released on 03/08/2021

- ‚ùó Compatibility with tui `0.16` and crossterm `0.20` ‚ùó
  - You can now set the block title alignment
    - Added `title` to `Props`
    - `BlockTitle` type in `Props`, which is made up of `text` and `alignment`. Use this instead of setting title in `own` map
  - üî¥ A really bad new in `Msg` matching üò≠

      in crossterm `0.20` to solve an issue they removed the `#[derive(Eq, PartialEq)]` from `KeyEvent`.
      This has now caused an issue when matching against `OnKey` events:

      ```txt
      error: to use a constant of type `KeyEvent` in a pattern, `KeyEvent` must be annotated with `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]`
      ```

      To solve this issue you must from now on use a guard match to match keys:

      ```rust
      fn update(model: &mut Model, view: &mut View, msg: Option<(String, Msg)>) -> Option<(String, Msg)> {
          let ref_msg: Option<(&str, &Msg)> = msg.as_ref().map(|(s, msg)| (s.as_str(), msg));
          match ref_msg {
              None => None, // Exit after None
              Some(msg) => match msg {
                  (COMPONENT_COUNTER1, key) if key == &MSG_KEY_TAB => {
                      view.active(COMPONENT_COUNTER2);
                      None
                  }
                  (COMPONENT_COUNTER2, key) if key == &MSG_KEY_TAB => {
                      view.active(COMPONENT_COUNTER1);
                      None
                  }
                  (_, key) if key == &MSG_KEY_ESC => {
                      // Quit on esc
                      model.quit();
                      None
                  }
                  _ => None,
              },
          }
      }
      ```
